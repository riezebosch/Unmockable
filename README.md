# Unmockable

Imagine you need a dependency on a 3rd party SDK where all types carry no interfaces, and all methods are not virtual.
Your only option is writing a wrapper that either implements an interface or has it methods marked virtual and does nothing 
more than passing through calls to the underlying object.

That's where this tiny library comes in. It acts as that handwritten wrapper for you.

## Not a replacement

For dependencies you have under control, introduce interfaces and use a regular mocking frameworks like [NSubstitute](https://nsubstitute.github.io/) or [Moq](https://github.com/moq/moq). 
Kindly send an email to the vendor of the SDK you're using if they could pretty please introduce some interfaces. It is a no-brainer
to extract an interface and it helps us to be [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID).

## Feature slim

This library has a very specific purpose and is deliberately not a full fledged mocking framework. Therefore 
I try to keep its features as slim as possible meaing:

-   All mocks are strict, each invocation requires explicit setup.
-   <s>There are are no</s> wild card [argument matchers](#Matchers).
-   The API is straightforward and sparse.
-   Wrapping `static` classes is [not supported](#Statics).

That being said I truly believe in _pure TDD_, so everything is written from a
red-green-refactor cycle and refactoring is done with [SOLID principles](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod) 
and [Design Patterns](https://dofactory.com/net/design-patterns) in hand.
If you spot a place where another pattern could be applied, don't hesitate to let me know.

## Different

What makes it different from [Microsoft Fakes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/isolating-code-under-test-with-microsoft-fakes), [Smocks](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Smocks/) or
 [Pose](https://github.com/tonerdo/pose) is that it only uses C# language constructs. There is no runtime rewriting or reflection/emit under the hood. Of course, this impacts the way you wrap and use
your dependency, but please, don't let us clean up someone else's ðŸ’©.

## ðŸ“¢ Shout-out

A big shoutout to Microsoft and other vendors to start **unit testing your SDKs** so you'll share our pain and give us some freaking extension points.

> [_Dependency Inversion Principle_](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod)  
> One should "depend upon abstractions, not on concretions."

Please, don't give us the `Unmockable<ðŸ–•>`.

## Usage

I prefer `NSubstitute` over `Moq` for its crisp API. But since we are (already) dealing
with `Expressions,` I felt it was more convenient (and easier for me to implement) to resemble the `Moq` API.  

### Inject

Inject an unmockable\* object:

```c#
public class SomeLogic
{
    public SomeLogic(IUnmockable<HttpClient> client)
    {
        _client = client;
    }
}
```

Execute using an expression:

```c#
public async Task DoSomething(int input)
{
    await _client.Execute(x => x.DownloadAsync(...));
}
```

\* The `HttpClient` is just a hand-picked example and not necessarily unmockable. There have been [some debate](https://github.com/aspnet/HttpClientFactory/issues/67)
around this type and it turns out to be mockable. As long as you are not afraid of message handlers. 

Concrete unmockable types (pun intented) I had to deal with recently are the [`ExtensionManagementHttpClient`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.services.extensionmanagement.webapi.extensionmanagementhttpclient) 
and the [`AzureServiceTokenProvider`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/src/SdkCommon/AppAuthentication/Azure.Services.AppAuthentication/AzureServiceTokenProvider.cs).

### Intercept

Inject an interceptor from a test using [Unmockable.Intercept](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unmockable.Intercept/):

```c#
var client = new Intercept<HttpClient>();
client
    .Setup(x => x.DownloadAsync(...))
    .Returns(...);

var target = new SomeLogic(client);
await target.DoSomething(3);

client.Verify();
```

Only strict 'mocks' are supported, meaning all invocations require setup and all setups demand invocation. 
Making it strict prevents you from staring at `NullReferenceExceptions` when an expected setup wasn't hit
and verification easy.

If you really want a [stub instead of a mock](https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html),
I'd recommend [auto-mocking](https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture/wiki/Cheat-Sheet#auto-mocking-with-moq) with [AutoFixture](https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture):

```c#
var fixture = new AutoFixture();
fixture
    .Customize(new AutoConfiguredNSubstituteCustomization());

var client = fixture
    .Create<IUnmockable<HttpClient>>();

var target = new SomeLogic(client);
await target.DoSomething(3);
```

## Optional arguments

Because of the `Expressions`, it is not possible to use default values from optional arguments.

> An expression tree cannot contain a call or invocation that uses optional arguments

Luckily this is easy with `default` literal for all arguments in C# 7.1:

```c#
client
    .Setup(x => x.InstallExtensionByNameAsync("asdf", "setvar", default, default, default))
    .Returns(new InstalledExtension());
```

**Remark**: This is the default value of the _type_, not necessarily the same as the default value of the _optional argument_!
On the plus side, you now have to express it both on the `Execute` and the `Setup` making it less error-prone. 

### Wrap

Inject the wrapper object using [Unmockable.Wrap](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unmockable.Wrap/):

```c#
services
    .AddTransient<IUnmockable<HttpClient>, Wrap<HttpClient>>();
services
    .AddScoped<HttpClient>();
```

Or wrap an existing object:

```c#
var client = new HttpClient().Wrap();
    
```

Or add wrappers for all services with [Unmockable.DependencyInjection](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unmockable.DependencyInjection/):

```c#
services
    .AddScoped<HttpClient>();
services
    .AddUnmockables();
```

**Remark:** The expressions are compiled on every invocation so it'll affect performance. 
I tried to add caching here, but that turns out not to be a sinecure.

## Matchers

Collection arguments are unwrapped when matching the actual call with provided setups! Value types, anonymous types _and_ reference types with a custom `GetHashCode()` should be safe.

Custom matching is done with `Arg.Ignore<T>()` and `Arg.Equals<T>(x => true/false)`, though the recommendation
 is to be explicit. 

## Statics

I first added and then removed support for 'wrapping' static classes and invoking static methods.
Because it is not an unmockable _object_! If you're dependent, let's say, on `DateTime.Now` you can already create an overloaded method that accepts the DateTime. You don't need a framework for that.

```c#
public void DoSomething(DateTime now)
{
    if (now ...) {}
}

public void DoSomething() => DoSomething(DateTime.Now)
```

Or with a factory method if it has to be more dynamic.

```c#
public void DoSomething(Func<DateTime> now)
{
    while (now() <= ...) {}
}

public void DoSomething() => DoSomething(() => DateTime.Now)
```

If you don't like this change in your public API, you can extract an interface and only
include the second method (which you should be doing anyway) or you mark the top method internal and
make it visible to your test project using `[InternalsVisibleTo]`.
